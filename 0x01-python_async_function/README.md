0x01. Python - Async

In Python, asynchronous programming, often referred to as async programming, allows you to write concurrent code that can handle multiple tasks at once without blocking the execution of other code.

Key concepts:
1. Coroutines:
2. Event Loop:
3. await Expression: 
4. Tasks and Futures:
5. Asynchronous Context    
   Managers:
6. Concurrency vs. 
   Parallelism: 
TASK:
0. The basics of async
1. Let's execute multiple   
   coroutines at the same time
   with async

2. Measure the runtime

3. Import wait_random from 
   0-basic_async_syntax.

4. Take the code from wait_n and alter it into a new function task_wait_n
